# YTS-Evaluation-Scheme-using-concepts-of-Game-Theory
A game theory perspective to look into allotment of incentives/marks based on a mechanism we design . 

- The mechanism is shown to have Bayesian Incentive Compatibility, that is each member involved is supposed to be truthful in his peer
review in expectation that others remain truthful to obtain the maximum utility. 

The discussion of the work is mainly confined in the paper YTS_evaluation_scheme.pdf . 

The codes are just utility functions to  evaluate the utilities to be awarded to each member, based on the first 2 social choice functions discussed in paper .
